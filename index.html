							<h1>Leticia Fernandez Moguel</h1>
							<h2>About myself</h2>
							<p class="major"> I grew up in Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico in a family of strong women. 
							Since a very early age I was amazed by science and the benefits it can bring to mankind. 
							This passion for science made me pursue a career as scientist and brought me to Europe, first to France and after to Switzerland, where I have settled. 
							After working  several years for a research institute, I decided to take a carrer break and stay at home with my kids for nearly 2 years; at the same time I have made a career change. 
							I am currently entering to the amazing world of Data Science and I am eager to contribute with my experience and knowledge to this field. </p>
							<p class="major"> </p>
							<h2>My passions</h2>
							<p class="major"> I am very proud of my latin Heritage. 
							The colors, the family, the people warmth, the music, the diferent flavours in the language, 
							the incredible nature and archeological sites, the delicious food. </p>

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>This is a summary of the main projects I have worked during my career. They all involved Data Analysis and modeling. Either physical/ chemical models or Data driven models. I also have had the opportunity to make experimental campaigns and code development. </p>

							<h2>Ultrasound tissue segmentation</h2>
							<p> Together with my team mates Roman Grisch and  Nicolas Bernath; we have developed a tool to identify tissues, like fat or muscle,  on ultrasounds based on a deep learning model with a UNET architecture. 
							It is expected that the model predictions would help healthcare providers to identify body parts in the US, but the medical diagnosis remains in the hands of the doctors.</p>

							<h2>Fukushima accident analysis</h2>
							<p>This is the most challenging, complex and interesting project I have done during my career. It was an OECD project. The most knowledgable experts around the globe in the simulations of nuclear accidents were present and I was not only part of it but actively contributing and leading the study of one of the damaged units (FU3). The results of this project would help the Japanese to find the best strategy to decommission the damaged plant. </p>

							<h2>CFD Fluidized Bed</h2>
							<p> This was my PhD project. I performed both experimental and simulation work with CFD. The model was complex since it involved mechanical, chemical and physical models. The PhD work is available (in French) on-line. Just press the bottom below to acces to it . </p>

							<h2>CFD in Oil and gas industry</h2>
							<p>This was my first profesional challenge. It was very fulfilling since I got to apply all the theory we learned in class in a real case problem. 
							It also made me acknowledge what I was capable for and that my work could actually have an impact in the industry. I performed CFD calculations in order to improve the efficiency of a separation unit of a three phase process (Oil, Gas and Water).
							Unfortunately, details of the project are not publicly available, but if someone is interested in the techniques can contact me on LinkedIn </p>
